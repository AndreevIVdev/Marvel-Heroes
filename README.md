# Marvel-Heroes

Marvel Heroes is a single view application for iPhone. It allows you to get information about all Heroes of Marvel Universe.
By using this Application you can take a look at their power, skills, wiki page and avatar. Also this app requires authorisation via Email/Password.

You can find in the code such technologies and methods like:
Json parsing, decoding.
Image downloading and caching, via URLSession and Kingfisher Library.
Asynchronous network calls, Rest api usage.
Closures, protocols/delegates, factories, coordinators, strategies.
Custom animating tableview elements movement.
Application is based at MVP architecture, navigation logic via coordinator.
Layout only in code, using NSLayoutConstaints.
Firebase and Realtime database usage.

This is of course only study project, that represents my skills and knowledges atm. February 2022.
